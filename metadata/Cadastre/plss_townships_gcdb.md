## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of the first-level hierarchical breakdown of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), where each unit represents six square miles or 23,040 acres.

## Summary

This datset represents the first-level hierarchical breakdown of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). UGRC created the township division class from the base attributes in the Geographic Coordinate Database ([GCDB](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e4a7fe4b07f02db648dce)).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Originally established in 1785 and currently administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the PLSS is a nationwide framework for surveying, dividing, and quantifying land. PLSS townships include 36 [sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-sections/) which are divided into a grid with 640 acres in each square, which is further divided into [quarter sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-quarter-sections/) (160 acres per square) and [quarter quarter sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-quarter-quarter-sections/) (40 acres per square).

The polygons in this feature class represent PLSS township areas that has been defined by the BLM. This data is derived from the [Utah PLSS Fabric](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcel-fabric/). Other PLSS datasets can be found in the [Cadastre Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

PLSS data are used in many areas of natural resource management, land ownership designation, and public planning. This dataset is also a helpful resource for cartography and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land Description (LLD) dataset, which can be found in the the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records system.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using cadastral survey records housed by the BLM, local records, and geographic control coordinates from states, counties, and federal agencies. We dissolved individual lots that were smaller than 40 acres to the section level. This data was originally published in January of 2017 and is currently maintained by UGRC in partnership with the BLM and local government authorities.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of PLSS townships in Utah. The geographic coordinates used in this dataset and their associated products are not a substitute for a legal land survey. They should only be used for record keeping, mapping, graphics, and planning purposes. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Land Management for use of the data for purposes not intended by BLM.
