## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset representing geographic boundaries of all school districts in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset is comprised of polygons representing the approximate geographic extent of all school districts in Utah. We maintain this layer using data provided by the school district offices and certified through the Lieutenant Governor's Office.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset is comprised of polygons representing the approximate geographic extent of all school districts in Utah. School districts are independently-operated government units managed by a publicly-elected school board. The majority of school districts in Utah are county-wide, but a few are smaller than the county they reside in (e.g. Alpine, Granite, and Jordan School Districts).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset serves as a resource for mapping the geographic extent and total enrollment of school districts in Utah. School district data are used in public planning, educational funding, taxes, and many other areas.

### What does the dataset represent?

School district boundaries are represented as polygons and include the school district name and total enrollment according to the Utah State Board of Education 2015-2016 [Fingertip Facts](https://schools.utah.gov/fingertipfacts) page.

<!--- The latest Fingertip Facts sheet is from 2019-2020. Are we planning on updating the total enrollment as the fingertip facts come out? -->

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC used coordinate geometry ([COGO](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/editing/introduction-to-cogo.htm)) from legal descriptions provided by the Utah State Tax Commission and the Utah State Board of Education to create this dataset. We maintain it by aggregating new data received from school district offices. All updates, corrections, or clarifications to the school district boundaries represented in this dataset must first be filed with the [Lieutenant Governor's](https://ltgovernor.utah.gov/) office. Once approved, UGRC adjusts the polygon boundaries accordingly.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the most complete version of Utah school district boundaries that have been verified by the Lieutenant Governor's Office. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.
