Census 2020 Block Groups

## ID

7bdd5e18-6eba-4e7e-b578-2168bde71090

## Brief Summary

Basic demographic data in the second-smallest geographic unit used by the US Census Bureau.

## Summary

Census Block Groups are aggregations of multiple [Census blocks](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/census-2020-block-groups/). Similar to [other Census datasets](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/) available on the SGID, only a limited amount of demographic information is available to preserve privacy.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

2020 Census Block Groups are units used by the United States Census Bureau which are geographically larger than a Census block but smaller than a [Census tract](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/census-2020-tracts/). They consist of aggregations of Census blocks and are subdivisions of Census tracts. Block groups generally have a total population of 600 to 3,000 people.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

Census bock groups consist of census blocks whose Census Block Number share the same first digit in a given census tract. For more information on how to interpret the Census Block Number, refer to [documentation](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2011/07/what-are-census-blocks.html) from the US Census Bureau. Census block groups in this dataset are represented as polygons and include basic demographic attributes.

### How was the dataset created?

Census block groups were originally delineated by locals participants in the US Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program ([PSAP](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/psap.html)) in collaboration with government authorities. The results of these efforts were made available in February 2021 along with other Census geographic data. The demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available later that year on August 12, 2021.

The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration with the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The data available on this page was downloaded from the [2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2). All 2020 census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the [census redistricting data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
